# Smile App
The Smile app is a photo album and editor featuring custom-built touch slide in/out navigation using UIGestureRecognizers, UIView animation, child view controllers and a UITableView menu.  Pictures can be imported from the Camera Roll or taken directly from the Camera using UIImagePickerController and display in a UICollectionView.  Pictures can also be saved back to the Camera Roll.  Images can be edited by applying Core Image filters and sent directly via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to nearby devices through Multipeer Connectivity.
